# MachineLearning-Assignment1
Make Money with Machine Learning course by Siraj Raval

Lesson 1 - Introduction

Homework Assignment (Image Classification)

First, this https://github.com/mtobeiyf/keras-flask-deploy-webapp  is the image classifier from the video from this week. Run it on your local machine to see how it works for yourself.

Now, we've been learning Python throughout this course because it's a very easy language to learn machine learning, but the homework for this week is going to be in the Javascript programming language! You might be thinking "Wait, why a different language?" Because if you're going to be making money using machine learning, you won't only be using Python. Javascript will help you build a web application, accessible from anyone's browser window! And if you want to build a mobile app, you'll want to learn Flutter, but we'll get to that later on in the course. 

The assignment this week is to build a simple image classifier as a web app. 

Follow this tutorial to build your first image classifier using Tensorflow.js (a javascript library) https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/transfer/image_classification 

Once your code is complete, upload it to GitHub and send the github link to gradedhomeworkassignments@gmail.com with your full name as the subject line. 

Here is how to upload code to GitHub https://medium.com/@sauravbhagat_10426/how-to-upload-code-to-github-6db1c8ff56aa  

Good luck!
